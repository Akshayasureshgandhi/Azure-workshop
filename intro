What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT services like compute power, storage, databases, and software over the internet, based on a pay-as-you-go pricing model.

Cloud Service Models

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Definition: Provides virtual machines and servers for hosting applications.
Example: Azure Virtual Machines

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Definition: Offers a virtual platform to build, deploy, and test applications without worrying about infrastructure.
Example: Azure App Service

3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
Definition: Provides software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for installation and maintenance.
Example: Microsoft 365

Benifits of cloud computing
1. Scalability
2. Accessibility
3. Improved Performance
4. Maintenance

Challenges in Cloud Adoption (SWOT Analysis)

Strengths:
Scalability: Easily adjust resources to meet demand.
Cost Effectiveness: Lower costs by reducing hardware and maintenance expenses.

Weaknesses:
Dependence on Internet: Reliable internet is necessary; downtime can lead to service disruption.
Data Security & Privacy Concerns: Storing sensitive data offsite can raise concerns.

Opportunities:
Growing Market Demand: Increased reliance on cloud computing across industries.
Emerging Technologies: Integration of AI, ML, and IoT with cloud services.

Threats:
Competition: The cloud computing market is highly competitive.
Regulatory Changes: Data protection regulations may impact cloud operations.

Azure Physical Infrastructure

Data Centers:
Definition: Facilities housing servers and networking equipment for Azure services.
Global Locations: Azure operates data centers worldwide.

Regions:
Definition: Azure organizes data centers into geographic regions.
Factors: Consider data privacy, speed, and service availability when selecting a region.
Example: US Cloud, China Cloud

Availability Zones:
Definition: Independent data centers within a region with separate power, cooling, and networking for high availability.


Core Architectural Components of Azure

1. Azure Regions: Geographically grouped data centers.
Example: North Central US, Japan West

2. Azure Sovereign Regions: Isolated regions with additional regulations.
Example: US, Germany, China

3. Azure Resources: Components like Virtual Machines, databases, and more.
Example: Azure Virtual Machines (VM)

4. Azure Subscription: Grants access to Azure services. Available as free or pay-as-you-go.
Example: Free Subscription, Pay-As-You-Go

5. Azure Policies: Governance policies applied at resource or group levels to enforce access control.

On-Premises vs. Cloud

On-Premises (Private Cloud): Managed entirely by the customer.
Customer manages all infrastructure and software, including:
     Data & Access
     Applications
     Runtime
     Operating System
     Virtual Machines
     Storage
     Networking
     Compute

Managed jointly between the customer and the cloud provider, depending on the service model (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
